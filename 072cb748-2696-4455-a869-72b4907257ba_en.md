# Terms of Use for Task Pulse

### Effective Date: April 08, 2025

**1. Introduction**
Welcome to Task Pulse, a reminder app designed for public users worldwide to manage tasks and receive timely notifications. This Terms of Use document outlines how we handle information related to the usage of our app and the permissions required for its functionality.

**2. Information Collection and Use**
Task Pulse does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users beyond what is necessary for its core functionality. All user data, such as task names, reminder times, and settings, is stored locally on your device. Minimal anonymous app performance data may be collected for analytics purposes to ensure stability and improve user experience.

**3. Permissions**
To provide its full range of features, Task Pulse requires the following Android permissions:

RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: Allows the app to restart scheduled reminders after your device reboots.
VIBRATE: Enables vibration alerts for reminders when configured by the user.
SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM: Permits the app to schedule precise reminder notifications at user-specified times.
WAKE_LOCK: Keeps the device awake briefly to ensure reminders are delivered on time.
FOREGROUND_SERVICE: Runs background processes to manage reminders reliably.
REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS: Requests permission to bypass battery optimization settings, ensuring consistent reminder delivery.
These permissions are requested during app installation or runtime, and you may choose to grant or deny them. Denying certain permissions may limit the appâ€™s functionality (e.g., reminders may not trigger if battery optimizations are enforced).

**4. Data Security**
Since Task Pulse stores all user data locally on your device and does not transmit it to external servers, there are no risks of unauthorized access from our end. We prioritize your privacy and ensure that your data remains secure under your control.

**5. User Responsibilities**
Users are responsible for using Task Pulse in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations. The app is intended for users of all ages, and we recommend configuring reminders responsibly. You are also responsible for managing permissions and ensuring your device settings align with your desired app functionality.

**6. Changes to the Terms of Use**
Task Pulse reserves the right to update or modify these terms at any time. Any changes will be communicated through the app, such as via a notification or an updated Terms of Use screen. Users are encouraged to review these terms periodically.

**7. Contact Us**
If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms of Use, please contact us at contact@nexraven.net.
