**Privacy Policy for Dine Finder**

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-13

NexRaven Innovations ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, Dine Finder (the "App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

**1. Information We Collect**

a. **Location Data:**
_ With your explicit consent, we collect your precise geographic location (using `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission) or coarse location (using `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission) to identify restaurants near you.
_ You can also choose to manually input a location. \* You can enable or disable location services when you use the App at any time through your mobile device settings.

b. **Usage and Technical Data (Anonymous Analytics):**
_ We automatically collect certain information when you use the App. This information is collected anonymously and is not linked to any directly identifiable personal data as no login is required. This data includes:
_ Search queries (e.g., "pizza," "sushi").
_ Interactions with the App's features (e.g., which restaurant details are viewed, filters used).
_ Aggregated and anonymized location information (e.g., city-level data for popular search areas).
_ Device type, operating system version.
_ Network information (via `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` to check connectivity).
\_ Anonymized device identifiers for analytics aggregation purposes only (e.g., advertising ID if used and resettable by user, or a randomly generated app instance ID). \* \* The purpose of collecting this anonymous data is solely for internal analytics to understand how our App is used, to improve its functionality, and to enhance user experience.

c. **Permissions Requested:**
_ `android.permission.INTERNET`: Allows the App to connect to the internet to fetch restaurant listings, map data, and other necessary information.
_ `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`: Allows the App to check if a network connection is available before attempting to fetch data.
_ `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: Allows the App to access your precise location to find nearby restaurants, only with your explicit consent.
_ `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: Allows the App to access your approximate location, only with your explicit consent.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

- To provide and operate the App's core functionality (locating and displaying restaurants).
- To understand usage patterns and improve the App's features, performance, and user experience through anonymous analytics.
- To monitor and analyze trends and usage.

**3. Sharing Your Information**
We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.

- **Anonymous Aggregated Data:** We may share aggregated, anonymized demographic and usage information with third-party analytics providers for the sole purpose of helping us understand App usage and improve our services. This data will not contain any information that can identify you personally.

- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.

**4. Data Storage, Security, and International Transfers**

- The anonymous analytical data we collect is stored on servers located in the United States.
- We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect the information we collect. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
- If you are using the App from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of your information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

**5. Data Retention**
We retain the anonymous analytical data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

**6. Your Privacy Rights**

- **Location Services:** You can control or disable access to your device's location information through your device settings or within the App if such functionality is provided.
- **Analytics:** As the analytics data is anonymous and not tied to a user account, specific access or deletion requests for this data may not be feasible. However, you can typically reset advertising identifiers on your device, which may limit the linkage of future anonymous data.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
